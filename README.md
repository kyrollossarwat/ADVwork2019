Transforming raw data into actionable insights through compelling visualizations. 
By leveraging the power of SQL and Microsoft Power BI, we will explore key trends, identify significant patterns, and uncover hidden opportunities.
SQL was employed to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, remove duplicates, and extracting the necessary columns for analysis.
By effectively visualizing the data, we have empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive positive change. 
The insights gained from this project will help improve efficiency, and increase revenue.
